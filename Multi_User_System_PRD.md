# Multi-User Finance Tracking System - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
Transform the current single-user Finance Track app into a comprehensive multi-user system where multiple users can create accounts, manage their own financial data, and switch between accounts seamlessly. All data will be stored locally with complete isolation between users.

## 2. Current State Analysis
- **Current Architecture**: Single user system with basic AuthManager
- **Data Storage**: Local SQLite database with no user isolation
- **Authentication**: Basic login/signup with server dependencies
- **Session Management**: Single session, no user switching capability

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Core User Management Features
- **Multiple User Accounts**: Support for unlimited local user accounts
- **User Registration**: Local account creation with username, email, and password
- **User Authentication**: Local password-based authentication
- **User Profile Management**: Full profile editing capabilities
- **Account Switching**: Seamless switching between different user accounts

### 3.2 Data Isolation Requirements
- **Complete Data Separation**: Each user's financial data must be completely isolated
- **User-Specific Storage**: All transactions, categories, budgets tied to specific user IDs
- **Session Persistence**: Remember last logged-in user
- **Data Integrity**: No cross-user data leakage

### 3.3 Enhanced Authentication System
- **Password Security**: Hashed password storage
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration
- **User Validation**: Proper input validation for all user data
- **Login History**: Track login attempts and sessions

### 3.4 User Interface Enhancements
- **User Selection Screen**: Clean interface to select or create users
- **Profile Management**: Comprehensive user profile editing
- **Account Settings**: User-specific settings and preferences
- **User Switching**: Quick user switching from main interface

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Enhanced Data Models
```kotlin
// Enhanced User Model
data class User(
    val id: Long = 0,
    val username: String,
    val email: String,
    val passwordHash: String,
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String,
    val profileImage: String? = null,
    val createdAt: String,
    val lastLoginAt: String? = null,
    val isActive: Boolean = true
)

// User Session Model
data class UserSession(
    val userId: Long,
    val username: String,
    val loginTime: Long,
    val lastActivityTime: Long,
    val isActive: Boolean
)
```

### 4.2 Database Schema Updates
- **Users Table**: Enhanced with password, profile fields
- **All Data Tables**: Add user_id foreign key constraint
- **Session Table**: Track active and past sessions
- **Migration Scripts**: Safe migration from single to multi-user

### 4.3 Core Components

#### AuthManager Enhancement
- Multi-user session management
- Password hashing and verification
- Session persistence and validation
- User switching capabilities

#### UserSessionManager (New)
- Active session tracking
- Session timeout management
- User preference storage
- Cross-session data cleaning

#### Enhanced Repository Layer
- User-specific data filtering
- Transaction isolation by user
- Data export/import per user
- Backup and restore capabilities

## 5. User Experience Flow

### 5.1 First Time Setup
1. Welcome screen with "Create First Account" option
2. User registration form (username, email, password)
3. Profile setup (optional additional details)
4. Dashboard access with empty state

### 5.2 Returning User Flow
1. User selection screen showing existing accounts
2. Password authentication for selected user
3. Direct access to user's personalized dashboard
4. All previous data intact and accessible

### 5.3 Multi-User Management
1. "Add New User" option from user selection screen
2. Quick user switching from main app (Settings menu)
3. User profile management and editing
4. Account deletion with data cleanup

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Data Protection
- Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms
- Local encryption of sensitive user data
- Secure session token generation
- Automatic session timeout for security

### 6.2 Data Isolation
- Database-level user isolation
- Application-level access control
- No shared data between users
- Complete data cleanup on user deletion

## 7. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Enhance User model and database schema
- Implement password hashing and authentication
- Create UserSessionManager
- Update AuthManager for multi-user support

### Phase 2: UI and UX
- Create user selection and registration screens
- Implement user switching interface
- Add profile management screens
- Update main app flow for multi-user

### Phase 3: Data Migration and Testing
- Implement safe migration from current system
- Comprehensive testing of user isolation
- Performance testing with multiple users
- Security validation and testing

## 8. Success Criteria
- Multiple users can create accounts and login independently
- Complete data isolation between different users
- Seamless user switching without data loss
- Existing single-user data preserved during migration
- Intuitive and user-friendly multi-user interface

## 9. Testing Scenarios

### 9.1 User Management Testing
- Create multiple test users (TestUser1, TestUser2)
- Verify independent data for each user
- Test user switching functionality
- Validate session persistence across app restarts

### 9.2 Data Isolation Testing
- Add transactions for different users
- Verify no cross-user data visibility
- Test data export/import per user
- Validate complete data cleanup on user deletion

### 9.3 Authentication Testing
- Test password validation and security
- Verify session timeout functionality
- Test login failure scenarios
- Validate user registration process

## 10. Future Enhancements
- Cloud sync per user account
- Shared family accounts with permissions
- Data export and backup per user
- Advanced user analytics and reporting
